# About nuxeo-util

Helpful elements for working with Polymer.

## Elements

### nuxeo-util-html-echo

An element An element for injecting HTML in Polymer DOM helper elements (e.g. "dom-if", "dom-repeat"). By default Polymer templates always escape HTML.


## nuxeo-util-mimetypes

A Polymer element for dealing with MIME types. Returns file extensions or "friendly" file types given a MIME type.


## Dependencies

Install Node.js (I use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/))

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install


## Demo

If you wish to work on the element in isolation, we recommend that you use [Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve -p 3000

Once running, you can view the element's documentation at `http://localhost:3000/components/nuxeo-util-html-echo/`, where `nuxeo-util-html-echo` is the name of the directory containing it.

To jump straight to the demo page, use `http://localhost:3000/components/nuxeo-util-html-echo/demo/index.html`.
